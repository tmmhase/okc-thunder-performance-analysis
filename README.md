## 📘 Overview

This project analyzes the **Oklahoma City Thunder’s 2023 NBA season performance** using R.  
It explores game-level trends, defensive efficiency, and the effects of **back-to-back (B2B)** scheduling on team outcomes.  
The goal is to demonstrate **sports analytics, data wrangling, and visualization** skills in a fully reproducible RMarkdown workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between **game schedule density** and **team performance**
- Examine **defensive effective field goal percentage (eFG%)** overall and in opponent B2B situations
- Visualize trends and summarize key takeaways using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`

---

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries

- **R** and **RMarkdown**
- `tidyverse` (for data manipulation and visualization)
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `lubridate`
- `kableExtra` (for formatted tables)
- `plotly` (for interactive visualizations)

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **BKN Defensive eFG%:** 54.5%  
- **When Opponent on a B2B:** 53.6%  
  → Slight decline in opponent shooting efficiency on back-to-backs

- **Back-to-Back Trend:**  
  - Average decline per year: **–0.5 back-to-backs**  
  - Total decline (2014–2023): **≈5 fewer B2Bs per team**

These findings highlight subtle performance differences caused by rest days and schedule compression — common areas of focus in modern NBA analytics.
